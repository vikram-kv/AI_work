initial implementation

base
cycle crossover with vanilla genetic algorithm

v1
added greedy heuristic code to have a backup solution 

v2
experimented with pmxcrossover - benefits not worth the cost of time

v3 
added simulated annealing on reedy --> great performance [ got 1138 on sample_50]
ch150 -> 7007
berlin52 -> 7544

to add - simulated annealing, experiment on non-rand init, crossover and mutation
