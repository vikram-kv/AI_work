Projects done as part of the Artificial Intelligence Course at IITM. 

Project 1 - TSP Solver based on heuristics. Devised a method to approximately solve TSP using a custom combination of several popular methods - Genetic Algorithms, 2-opt, 3-opt, simulated annealing and greedy heuristic.

Project 2 - Othello Game playing bot. Implemented an Othello game-playing bot that uses AlphaBeta Pruning along with a custom eval() function to calculate the value of the game after a few moves lookahead.
